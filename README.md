This is the Code Warrior's final group project for CS 477: Server-side Programming. In addition to the features listed in the original project speculation, extra features include:

- Validate users' inputs and provide error messages
- Upload picture directly as a file using Multer (not as a path or URL)
- Verify new users with validation code via email using Nodemailer
- Display unique welcome page with each user's first name



We didn't break out each feature into individual tasks and assign them to individuals; instead, we started from scratch, paired off, and worked together on sections (products, users) from end-to-end, as well as collaborated together on things like UI, debugging, extra features, etc.



We hope you enjoy our app as much as we enjoyed making it!
